Welcome to our AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics!

This project was built as part of a hackathon to create a modern, interactive learning experience. Our goal is to bridge the gap between digital AI that lives in the cloud and physical embodiment that acts in the real world.

### What You Will Learn

Throughout this textbook, you will learn to:
- **Control robots** using the industry-standard ROS 2.
- **Simulate them** in realistic environments like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
- **Give them a "brain"** using modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

We believe that the future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents, and robots. This textbook is your first step into that future.

Let's start building, one robot at a time!
