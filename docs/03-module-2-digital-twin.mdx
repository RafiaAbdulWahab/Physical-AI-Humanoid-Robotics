# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

In this module, we will create a "Digital Twin"—a virtual replica of our robot and its environment. This allows us to test and train our AI in a safe, simulated world before deploying it to a physical robot.

### Focus: Physics Simulation and Environment Building

We will use two powerful tools for this:

1.  **Gazebo:** For realistic physics simulation.
2.  **Unity:** For high-fidelity rendering and advanced interactions.

### What You'll Learn in Gazebo

Gazebo is a robust physics simulator that helps us model the real world. We will focus on:
- **Simulating Physics:** Understanding how gravity, friction, and mass affect the robot.
- **Collisions:** Detecting when the robot bumps into objects. We will learn to design worlds with walls, obstacles, and other items.
- **Environment Building:** Creating custom worlds for the robot to navigate.

<world name="default">
  <include>
    <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
  </include>
  <include>
    <uri>model://sun</uri>
  </include>
  <model name="box">
    <pose>0 2 0.5 0 0 0</pose>
    <link name="link">
      <collision name="collision">
        <geometry>
          <box>
            <size>1 1 1</size>
          </box>
        </geometry>
      </collision>
      <visual name="visual">
        <geometry>
          <box>
            <size>1 1 1</size>
          </box>
        </geometry>
      </visual>
    </link>
  </model>
</world>
```

### High-Fidelity Rendering in Unity

While Gazebo is great for physics, Unity excels at creating visually stunning and interactive environments. We will explore:
- **Photorealistic Graphics:** Making the simulated world look as real as possible.
- **Human-Robot Interaction:** Creating scenarios where virtual humans can interact with our robot.

### Simulating Sensors

A robot is blind without its sensors. We will learn to simulate the most critical sensors:
- **LiDAR:** To measure distances using l
