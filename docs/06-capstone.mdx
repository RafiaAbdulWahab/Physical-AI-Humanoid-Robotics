# Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

This is the final project where you will combine everything you have learned throughout this course. The goal is to build a simulated **Autonomous Humanoid** that can understand a voice command, perceive its environment, plan a path, and manipulate an object.

### The Challenge

Your task is to create a complete end-to-end pipeline that performs the following sequence:

1.  **Receive a Voice Command:** The system should listen for a command like, "Find the blue cube and place it on the green circle."
2.  **Transcribe and Plan:** The voice command will be converted to text (using Whisper) and then sent to an LLM to generate a step-by-step plan.
3.  **Navigate and Perceive:** The robot must navigate to the target area, avoiding obstacles using Nav2. It will then use its camera to identify the correct object (the blue cube) using computer vision.
4.  **Manipulate:** The robot must accurately calculate how to grasp the cube, pick it up with its arm, and carry it to the destination (the green circle).
5.  **Place and Complete:** Finally, it must gently place the cube at the target location and return to a neutral stance.

### The Workflow: A Summary of Your Skills

Your project will demonstrate your mastery of the entire stack:

- **Frontend (Voice Input):** A simple interface to capture the voice command.
- **VLA (The Brain):**
  - **Whisper** for Speech-to-Text.
  - An **LLM** for cognitive planning.
- **ROS 2 (The Nervous System):**
  - Your Python script will translate the LLM's plan into ROS 2 actions (e.g., `navigate_to_goal`, `pick_up_object`).
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim (The World):**
  - The entire task will be performed in a realistic virtual environment you design.
  - The robot's perception will be based on the simulated camera and LiDAR data from Isaac Sim.

### Example Project Flowchart

    A[Voice Command] --> B{Whisper API};
    B --> C[Text: "Get the cube"];
    C --> D{LLM Planner};
    D --> E[Plan: 1. navigate(table) 2. grasp(cube)];
    E --> F[ROS 2 Action Client];
    F -- navigate_to_goal --> G[Nav2 in Isaac Sim];
    G -- Reaches Goal --> F;
    F -- pick_up_object --> H[Manipulation in Isaac Sim];
    H -- Success --> I[Task Complete];
```

Successfully completing this capstone project will not only solidify your understanding of Physical AI but also provide you with a powerful portfolio piece demonstrating your ability to build intelligent, embodied systems.
