# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI! This course is designed to bridge the gap between the digital "brain" of artificial intelligence and the physical "body" of a robot.

### What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to AI systems that can function in the real world, understand physical laws, and interact with their environment. Unlike a chatbot that lives on the internet, a physical AI agent must comprehend concepts like gravity, friction, space, and time. Its goal is to perform meaningful tasks in our physical world.

### Embodied Intelligence: The Core Theme

The central theme of this course is **Embodied Intelligence**. We will explore how to give our AI models a physical "body"—in this case, a humanoid robot—allowing them to learn and act based on sensory input from the real world.

### Hardware at a Glance

This is a technically demanding course. To build and simulate intelligent robots, you will need two key pieces of hardware:

1.  **The "Digital Twin" Workstation (Sim Rig):**
    - A powerful PC with an **NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM)** or higher.
    - This machine will run the realistic physics simulations in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

2.  **The "Physical AI" Edge Kit (Edge Brain):**
    - An **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**.
    - This is a small, powerful computer where you will deploy your trained AI models to control a real-world robot.

This course will take you on a journey from writing your first ROS 2 node to deploying a fully autonomous humanoid robot in a simulated environment. Let's get started!
